# Learning GO

## Skiing and Snowboarding

Skiing : Easy to Learn, Hard to Master

- Java/C# easy to learn:

- Schools teach it, plenty of learning resources, IDE support

- lots of features (generics, reflection)

- plenty of examples of OO design patterns and best practices

- Java/#C hard to master:

- Concurrency as afterthought library. Lots to setup and maintain

- Spring DI does a lot of magic behind the scenes, harder to debug

Snowboarding : Hard to learn, easy to master
    
- go hard to learn: 

- limited IDE support (Visual Studio Code with extensions, Jetbrains Goland with subscription)

- hard to get user to pointers, package structure

- Not all of the extra features, no reflection

- Have to setup design patterns from scratch, no DI (Spring, Autofac)

- Go easy to master:

- concurrency built in, easy to setup and run
